# TicTacToe-multiplayer-with-socket.io-in-Node.js
An implementation of TIC-TAC-TOE multiplayer game using socket.io module in Node.js


The software is developed for only 2 players connected. So, if there are more than 2 players, can be errors.


You have to start index.js file with 'node index.js'.

If you run this in local machine, the default PORT is 3000 (localhost:3000).

If you run this in a hosting server, the set PORT will be the enviroment PORT on the server settings (url:PORT).

"public" folder contains HTML, CSS, JavaScipt resources for client browser GUI (front-end).


"src" folder cointains the back-end. These files are the server development.
